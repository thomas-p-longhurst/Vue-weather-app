# Vue.js Weather App

For this assignment, I used Vue.js to make a simple single-page application that uses several APIs to predict the weather in the user's location. Each forecast can be clicked to mark it as likely, unlikely, or neutral. There is also a Software Development Plan found in [doc](/doc) in the format of an HTML document.

## Original README.md
```
SDP can be found in [doc](/doc). The code I've written can be found in [src](/src). 
Files in [src/lecture-singalong](/src/lecture-sinaglong) are files I made when following along with lectures and
can be ignored.
